RankLyft does not maintain its own index. The primary source of SEO data — keyword rankings, backlinks, traffic estimates, SERP positions, site audit results, and AI mention data — is [DataForSEO](https://dataforseo.com), a pay-per-call API used by many enterprise SEO platforms.

In addition to DataForSEO, RankLyft optionally connects to **Google Search Console** and **Google Analytics 4** for real first-party data. When connected, GSC provides actual clicks, impressions, and CTR, while GA4 provides real sessions, engagement, and conversions. See [Google Integrations](/features/google-integrations) for setup instructions.

Understanding which API backs each feature helps you interpret data freshness, understand cost drivers, and set accurate expectations with clients.

## API types

DataForSEO offers two fundamentally different data types:

| Type | How it works | Speed | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pre-indexed** | Returns data from DataForSEO's continuously updated index | Near-instant (seconds) | Lower |
| **Live** | Performs a real-time crawl or SERP query at the moment of the request | Minutes to hours | Higher |

Most of RankLyft's features use pre-indexed data. Live queries are reserved for features where real-time accuracy is required — position tracking, site audits, and AI visibility checks.

## Feature-to-API mapping

| Feature | DataForSEO API | Namespace | Data type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Domain Overview | `googleDomainRankOverviewLive` | Labs | Pre-indexed |
| Historical Trends | `googleHistoricalRankOverviewLive` | Labs | Pre-indexed |
| Organic Rankings | `googleRankedKeywordsLive` | Labs | Pre-indexed |
| Top Pages | `googleRelevantPagesLive` | Labs | Pre-indexed |
| Position Tracking | `googleOrganicTaskPost` | SERP | Live SERP |
| Keyword Overview | `googleKeywordOverviewLive` | Labs | Pre-indexed |
| Keyword Suggestions | `googleKeywordSuggestions` | Labs | Pre-indexed |
| Related Keywords | `googleRelatedKeywords` | Labs | Pre-indexed |
| Competitors | `googleCompetitorsDomain` | Labs | Pre-indexed |
| Keyword Gap | `googleDomainIntersection` | Labs | Pre-indexed |
| Backlinks | `summary`, `referring_domains`, `history` | Backlinks | Pre-indexed |
| Site Audit | `task_post` + `pages` | On-Page | Live crawl |
| AI Visibility | `llm_mentions`, `top_pages`, `aggregated_metrics` | AI Optimization | Live query |
| Traffic Analytics | GA4 Data API | Google Analytics 4 | Real (first-party) |
| GSC Performance | Search Console API | Google Search Console | Real (first-party) |

## API namespaces

DataForSEO organizes its APIs into namespaces. RankLyft uses four of them:

### Labs

The DataForSEO Labs namespace contains Google-indexed SEO metrics — keywords a domain ranks for, traffic estimates, keyword ideas, and competitive overlap data. Results come from DataForSEO's own index, which they update continuously. Labs is the backbone of most RankLyft features.

### SERP

The SERP namespace performs actual Google searches and returns the real results page. RankLyft uses the async task variant (`googleOrganicTaskPost`) for position tracking: it submits a batch of keyword searches, waits for Google to return results, and stores the positions. This is slower and more expensive than Labs data, but it gives you the actual current SERP rather than an indexed estimate.

### Backlinks

The Backlinks namespace provides link data including referring domain counts, anchor text, and link history. Backlinks is a separate DataForSEO product with its own pricing tier and a $100/month minimum commitment. RankLyft hides Backlinks features behind a feature flag until you are ready to enable that spend.

### On-Page

The On-Page namespace crawls a website page-by-page and returns technical SEO audit data. Unlike Labs, On-Page sends real HTTP requests to your client's site. JavaScript-rendered pages cost significantly more because DataForSEO must run a headless browser.

### AI Optimization

The AI Optimization namespace queries large language models (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, etc.) and checks whether a domain appears in the responses. Because this requires making live LLM API calls, it is slower and more expensive per request than Labs. AI Optimization also carries a $100/month minimum commitment.

<Info>
  Not all DataForSEO namespaces are enabled by default in RankLyft. Backlinks and AI Optimization are gated behind feature flags because they carry separate minimum commitments. Contact your PageLyft administrator to enable them.

### Google APIs

RankLyft optionally connects to two Google APIs to supplement DataForSEO estimates with real first-party data:

- **Google Search Console API** — provides actual clicks, impressions, CTR, and average position from Google search results. GSC data is merged into the [Organic Rankings](/features/organic-rankings) table and shown on the [Dashboard](/features/dashboard) GSC Performance card.
- **Google Analytics 4 Data API** — provides real sessions, users, engagement metrics, bounce rates, and conversions. GA4 data powers the [Traffic Analytics](/features/traffic-analytics) page, the Dashboard GA4 cards, and the [Top Pages](/features/top-pages) GA4 overlay.

Unlike DataForSEO, which provides estimates based on its own index, Google APIs return real data from the actual Google properties. This makes them ideal for validating estimates and reporting actual performance to clients. Both integrations are optional — all core features work with DataForSEO alone.

## Data geography

DataForSEO Labs data is pulled for **US English Google** results by default. Position tracking can be configured per-keyword to target different countries and languages. Site audits crawl the domain regardless of geography. AI Visibility queries are run against US-accessible LLM endpoints.

## What RankLyft does not use

RankLyft does not use Semrush, Ahrefs, or Moz. SEO estimate data is sourced through DataForSEO, and real traffic and search data comes from optional Google Search Console and Google Analytics 4 connections. If you notice a discrepancy between RankLyft and another tool, the difference is almost always attributable to index methodology, update frequency, or geographic targeting — not a RankLyft error.
