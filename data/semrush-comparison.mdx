description: "A direct comparison of RankLyft and Semrush across cost, features, data limits, and update frequency — including honest tradeoffs."
---

RankLyft and Semrush both pull from the DataForSEO API as part of their data stack, but they approach pricing very differently. Semrush charges a fixed monthly subscription with hard limits by plan. RankLyft charges based on actual API usage with no per-seat or per-project caps.

This page gives you a direct comparison so you can make an informed decision about which tool fits your agency.

## Cost comparison

| Plan | Semrush | RankLyft equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| Entry | Pro — $139.95/mo | Core (depth 10) — ~$10–25/mo |
| Mid | Guru — $249.95/mo | Core + Backlinks — ~$110–130/mo |
| Power | Business — $499.95/mo | Full platform — ~$230–280/mo |

RankLyft costs 60–92% less than comparable Semrush plans depending on your usage level.

<Info>
  The full-platform RankLyft estimate ($230–280/mo) includes Backlinks and AI Visibility, both of which carry $100/mo DataForSEO minimum commitments. Core usage without those add-ons runs $15–90/mo depending on tracking depth and domain count.
</Info>

## Plan limits

Semrush enforces hard limits by plan. RankLyft has no project caps, seat limits, or keyword tracking maximums — you pay per API call, not per unit of access.

| Limit | Semrush Pro | Semrush Guru | Semrush Business | RankLyft |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Projects | 5 | 15 | 40 | Unlimited |
| Tracked keywords | 500 | 1,500 | 5,000 | Unlimited (pay per keyword/day) |
| Seats | 1 | 1 | 3 | Unlimited |
| Historical data | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Content marketing | No | Yes | Yes | No |
| API access | No | No | Yes | Via DataForSEO directly |

## Feature comparison

<Accordion title="Domain overview and ranking data">
  | Feature | Semrush | RankLyft |
  |---|---|---|
  | Estimated organic traffic | Yes | Yes |
  | Estimated traffic value | Yes | Yes |
  | Domain authority score | Yes (Authority Score) | Yes (via DataForSEO) |
  | Historical trends | Guru+ | Yes |
  | Ranked keywords shown | Unlimited | Up to 100 (top 100 by traffic) |
  | Organic ranking update frequency | Daily | Weekly |

  **Honest tradeoff:** Semrush shows you all keywords a domain ranks for — hundreds or thousands. RankLyft caps the Organic Rankings view at the top 100 keywords by traffic. If you need full keyword footprint analysis on domains with large organic presence, Semrush has an advantage here. For most agency clients, the top 100 keywords represent the bulk of meaningful traffic.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Position tracking">
  | Feature | Semrush | RankLyft |
  |---|---|---|
  | Daily keyword tracking | Yes | Yes |
  | Tracking depth (positions shown) | 1–100 | Configurable (10 or 100) |
  | Keyword limit | By plan (500–5,000) | Unlimited |
  | Historical position history | Yes | Yes |
  | Visibility score | Yes | Yes |
  | Competitor tracking | Yes | No (competitors tracked separately) |
  | Mobile tracking | Yes | No |

  **Honest tradeoff:** Semrush's position tracking includes mobile rankings and side-by-side competitor tracking in the same view. RankLyft tracks desktop positions only and shows competitor data in a separate Competitors report. If mobile tracking or real-time competitor position monitoring is a client deliverable, Semrush handles it more completely.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keyword research">
  | Feature | Semrush | RankLyft |
  |---|---|---|
  | Keyword overview (volume, KD, CPC) | Yes | Yes |
  | Keyword suggestions | Yes | Yes |
  | Related keywords | Yes | Yes |
  | Keyword gap analysis | Yes | Yes |
  | SERP features shown | Yes | No |
  | Intent classification | Yes | No |
  | Bulk keyword export | Yes | Yes (via export button) |

  **Honest tradeoff:** Semrush enriches keyword results with intent classification (informational, navigational, commercial, transactional) and shows which SERP features appear for a keyword (featured snippets, People Also Ask, etc.). RankLyft does not include these enrichments. If keyword intent filtering is part of your content strategy workflow, you will notice the gap.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Backlinks">
  | Feature | Semrush | RankLyft |
  |---|---|---|
  | Referring domain count | Yes | Yes (if enabled) |
  | Backlink history | Yes | Yes (if enabled) |
  | Anchor text breakdown | Semrush index | Limited |
  | New/lost link alerts | Yes | No |
  | Link building tool | Yes | No |
  | Toxic link score | Yes | No |

  **Honest tradeoff:** Semrush has a more mature backlink product with link alerts, toxicity scoring, and a built-in link building workflow. RankLyft's backlink data covers the core metrics — total links, referring domains, and trend — but does not replicate the full Semrush link audit workflow. If backlink remediation is a core service, Semrush is stronger.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Site audit">
  | Feature | Semrush | RankLyft |
  |---|---|---|
  | Technical crawl | Yes | Yes |
  | JavaScript rendering | Yes | Yes |
  | Crawl schedule | Daily/weekly/monthly | Daily or on-demand |
  | Number of checks | 140+ | Fewer (DataForSEO On-Page set) |
  | Core Web Vitals | Yes | No |
  | Issue prioritization | Yes | No |
  | Crawl comparison | Yes | No (single snapshot) |

  **Honest tradeoff:** Semrush runs 140+ audit checks with built-in issue prioritization, crawl-over-crawl comparison, and Core Web Vitals integration. RankLyft's audit covers the DataForSEO On-Page check set, which handles the most common technical issues but is less comprehensive. For clients with complex technical SEO problems, Semrush's audit provides more diagnostic depth.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Competitive intelligence">
  | Feature | Semrush | RankLyft |
  |---|---|---|
  | Competitor discovery | Yes | Yes |
  | Keyword gap | Yes | Yes |
  | Traffic share analysis | Yes | No |
  | Ad research | Yes | No |
  | Market explorer | Yes | No |

  **Honest tradeoff:** Semrush's competitive intelligence extends into paid search research, market share analysis, and industry-level traffic trends. RankLyft covers organic competitor discovery and keyword gap — the two most commonly used workflows — but does not include paid research or market-level views.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Reporting and exports">
  | Feature | Semrush | RankLyft |
  |---|---|---|
  | CSV/Excel export | Yes | Yes |
  | PDF reports | Yes | No |
  | Branded reports | Yes | No |
  | Scheduled email reports | Yes | No |
  | White-label | Business plan only | N/A |

  **Honest tradeoff:** Semrush has a full report builder with branded PDF output and scheduled email delivery. RankLyft exports data as CSV. If automated client-facing PDF reports are part of your deliverable workflow, you will need to build those reports manually from RankLyft's CSV exports, or continue using Semrush's report builder alongside RankLyft.
</Accordion>

## When RankLyft is the right choice

- You manage 5+ client websites and Semrush's per-project limits are a constant friction point
- You want to pay for API calls rather than a flat subscription that includes features you do not use
- You are tracking 50–200 keywords per client and the cost math clearly favors usage-based pricing
- Your primary deliverables are ranking reports, keyword research, and technical audits — not mobile tracking, link alerts, or PDF report automation

## When Semrush is the right choice

- You need mobile position tracking
- You need full keyword footprint visibility beyond the top 100 keywords
- You rely on Semrush's report builder for client-facing PDF deliverables
- You need link toxicity scoring or a built-in link building workflow
- You need keyword intent classification as part of your content strategy process

## Cost savings summary

| Semrush plan | Annual cost | RankLyft equivalent | Annual savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pro ($139.95/mo) | $1,679/yr | Core at $25/mo ($300/yr) | ~$1,379/yr |
| Guru ($249.95/mo) | $2,999/yr | Core + Backlinks at $130/mo ($1,560/yr) | ~$1,439/yr |
| Business ($499.95/mo) | $5,999/yr | Full platform at $270/mo ($3,240/yr) | ~$2,759/yr |

<Tip>
  Most agencies find the right starting point is enabling core Labs and SERP features first (roughly $15–25/month), then adding Backlinks and AI Visibility only when clients ask for those specific reports. You can enable each feature incrementally rather than committing to the full platform cost upfront.
