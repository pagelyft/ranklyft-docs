AI Visibility tracks whether a client's domain is being cited by large language models when users ask questions related to their business. As more searches resolve in AI-generated answers rather than traditional blue-link results, this report helps you monitor a channel that standard rank tracking does not cover.

<Warning>
  AI Visibility is a feature-flagged report. It must be enabled with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_AI_VISIBILITY` environment variable before it appears in the sidebar. Contact your admin if you expect to see this report but don't see it in the navigation.
</Warning>

## Platforms tracked

RankLyft checks for domain mentions across five AI platforms:

- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
- **Google AI Overviews**
- **Gemini** (Google)
- **Perplexity**
- **Claude** (Anthropic)

Each platform surfaces different answers for the same query, so a domain may appear on some platforms but not others.

## Summary metrics

Four metric cards appear at the top of the AI Visibility page:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Total Mentions | The total number of times the domain was mentioned across all platforms and queries |
| Citations | The number of mentions where the AI directly cited the domain as a source |
| Citation Rate | Citations as a percentage of total mentions |
| Platform Count | The number of distinct AI platforms where the domain appeared |

A high mention count with a low citation rate suggests the AI is referencing the brand in passing but not linking to it as a source. Work on structured content, schema markup, and authoritative reference pages to increase citations.

## Mentions table

The mentions table shows every recorded AI mention with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Keyword | The search query that triggered the AI response |
| Platform | The AI platform that generated the answer, displayed as a color-coded badge |
| Cited | Whether the domain was directly cited as a source (Yes/No) |
| Answer Snippet | The portion of the AI-generated answer that referenced the domain |
| Volume | Monthly search volume for the keyword |

Use the Answer Snippet column to understand how AI platforms are characterizing the client's brand and content. Inconsistent or inaccurate characterizations may indicate thin or outdated content that needs updating.

## Top pages table

The top pages table shows which URLs on the domain are most frequently mentioned or cited across AI platforms:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| URL | The page on the client's domain |
| Mentions | Total times this URL appeared in AI answers |
| Citations | Times this URL was cited as a direct source |

Pages with high mentions but low citations are appearing in AI context but not being linked. These pages are good candidates for adding more authoritative, citable content — statistics, original research, definitions, or how-to guides.

<Tip>
  AI platforms tend to cite content that is clearly structured, factually specific, and up to date. If you want to improve a page's citation rate, focus on adding citable facts, clear authorship signals, and schema markup.

## How this differs from traditional rankings

Traditional organic rankings track whether a domain appears on the Google SERP for a query. AI Visibility tracks whether the domain appears inside an AI-generated answer — which may or may not include a clickable link. A domain can have strong traditional rankings but zero AI visibility, or vice versa.

Monitor both. As AI search features expand, AI Visibility will become an increasingly important part of the client reporting conversation.
