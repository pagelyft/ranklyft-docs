description: "Summary metrics, historical trends, and a referring domain table for a client's backlink profile."
---

The Backlinks report gives you an overview of a domain's link profile: how many backlinks it has, where they come from, how authoritative those sources are, and how the link count has changed over time.

<Warning>
  Backlinks is a feature-flagged report. It must be enabled with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_BACKLINKS` environment variable before it appears in the sidebar. Contact your admin if you expect to see this report but don't see it in the navigation.
</Warning>

## Summary metrics

Four metric cards appear at the top of the Backlinks page:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Total Backlinks | The total number of individual links pointing to the domain |
| Referring Domains | The number of unique domains linking to the site |
| Domain Rank | The domain's authority score on a 0–1000 scale. Higher is stronger. |
| Broken Backlinks | Links pointing to pages that return a 404 or other error |

<Tip>
  Referring Domains is typically a more meaningful signal than Total Backlinks. A single high-authority domain linking 50 times is less valuable than 50 different referring domains. Focus on growing the referring domain count, not just the backlink count.
</Tip>

## History chart

The history chart plots two lines over time:

- **Backlinks** — the total number of backlinks
- **Referring Domains** — the number of unique linking domains

Use this chart to detect link losses (which may coincide with ranking drops), identify when link-building campaigns took effect, or spot unnatural spikes that could indicate a spam attack.

## Referring domains table

The table lists every domain linking to the client's site with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Domain | The referring domain's root URL |
| Domain Rank | The referring domain's authority score (0–1000) |
| Backlinks | The number of individual links from this domain |
| Spam Score | A 0–100 score indicating how likely the domain is to be spammy. Higher is worse. |
| First Seen | The date RankLyft first detected a link from this domain |

Sort by **Domain Rank** to find your most authoritative links, or by **Spam Score** to identify low-quality links that may be worth disavowing.

## Refresh schedule

Backlink data is refreshed weekly when the feature is enabled. Because backlink data changes more slowly than rankings, weekly updates are sufficient for most agency workflows. See [Refresh Schedules](/data/refresh-schedules) for exact timing.
