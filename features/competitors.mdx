The Competitors tool identifies domains that rank for many of the same keywords as a target domain. Enter any domain to see its top organic search competitors ranked by keyword overlap.

## Running a competitor search

Enter a domain in bare format (no `https://`, no trailing slash) and click **Search**. RankLyft queries the DataForSEO competitors API and returns a table of competing domains sorted by the number of keywords they share with the target.

```
example.com
```

The search is not tied to a specific client website — you can look up any domain at any time.

## Results table

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Domain | The competing domain. Click any domain in this column to run a new competitor search for that domain. |
| Common Keywords | The number of keywords both the target domain and this competitor rank for in the top 100. Used as the default sort. |
| Organic Keywords | The total number of keywords this competitor ranks for (not limited to shared terms) |
| Organic Traffic | The competitor's estimated monthly organic traffic |
| Traffic Value | The estimated monthly USD value of the competitor's organic traffic |
| Paid Keywords | The number of keywords the competitor buys in Google Ads |
| Avg Position | The competitor's average ranking position across all their ranked keywords |

## Sorting and navigating

The table sorts by **Common Keywords** descending by default. Domains at the top share the most keyword overlap with your target — these are the true head-to-head competitors in search.

Click any domain in the Domain column to pivot the search. RankLyft runs a new competitor lookup with that domain as the target. This lets you quickly map a competitive landscape by bouncing between related domains.

## How to use competitor results

**Identify the real competition.** Clients often think their competitors are the businesses they know from industry events. Organic search competitors are frequently different — they may be media sites, directories, or adjacent-industry domains that rank for the same queries. Show clients who they're actually competing against in search.

**Find content opportunities by studying top competitors.** Competitors with high organic keyword counts but low common keyword overlap may be covering topics the client hasn't addressed. Use [Keyword Gap](/features/keyword-gap) to find exactly which keywords a top competitor ranks for that the client doesn't.

**Benchmark the client's traffic value.** Compare the client's estimated traffic value against competitors to frame the business impact of ranking improvements. If the top competitor's traffic is worth $50,000/month and the client's is worth $8,000/month, that gap translates directly to revenue potential.

<Tip>
  Start with the top 3 competitors by Common Keywords and run a Keyword Gap analysis against each one. This workflow surfaces the fastest content opportunities in the client's competitive space.
