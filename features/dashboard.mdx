The Dashboard is the first screen you see when you open a website. It gives you a quick read on organic performance, real traffic from Google integrations, tracked keyword health, and quick-win opportunities — all without navigating to a deeper report.

When [Google Integrations](/features/google-integrations) are connected, additional cards appear showing real GA4 traffic and GSC search performance alongside the DataForSEO estimates.

## Widgets

### SEO Summary

The SEO Summary card shows the domain's current estimated organic footprint with five metrics, each paired with a sparkline showing recent trend direction:

| Metric | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Organic Traffic | Estimated monthly organic visits |
| Organic Keywords | Total keywords the domain ranks for |
| Traffic Value | Estimated monthly value of organic traffic in USD |
| Paid Keywords | Number of keywords the domain buys in Google Ads |
| Referring Domains | Count of unique domains linking to the site |

The sparklines reflect the last several months of data. Use them to spot sudden drops or growth before digging into the full trend chart in Domain Overview.

### GA4 Traffic Card

Shows a summary of real website traffic from Google Analytics 4:

| Metric | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Users | Unique visitors during the period |
| Sessions | Total sessions started |
| Engaged Sessions | Sessions lasting 10+ seconds, with a conversion, or 2+ page views |
| Avg. Engagement | Average engagement time per session |
| Engagement Rate | Percentage of engaged sessions |

A channel trend chart below the metrics shows how traffic is distributed across acquisition channels over time.

  This card only appears when a GA4 property is connected. See [Google Integrations](/features/google-integrations) for setup. For the full traffic breakdown, visit [Traffic Analytics](/features/traffic-analytics).

### GA4 Top Pageviews

A table showing the top pages by pageviews from GA4:

| Column | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Page | The page path |
| Pageviews | Total pageviews during the period |
| Users | Unique users who viewed the page |
| Avg. Time on Page | Average time users spent on the page |

### GSC Performance Card

</Info>

### Position Tracking Card

This card summarizes the health of your actively tracked keywords:

- **Visibility** — the estimated share of clicks your tracked keywords receive, based on their current positions
- **Position buckets** — a breakdown showing how many tracked keywords fall in top 3, 4–10, 11–20, and 21+ positions
- **Top 5 keywords** — the five tracked keywords with the highest search volume, with their current position

<Info>
  Position data updates daily at 6 AM UTC. If you just added a website, this card will populate the following morning.

### Top Keywords Preview

Shows the five keywords driving the most estimated traffic to the domain. Each row displays the keyword, its current position, and monthly search volume. Click any keyword to open the full Organic Rankings table filtered to that keyword.

### Top Pages Preview

Shows the five pages driving the most estimated organic traffic. Each row displays the page URL and its estimated monthly traffic value. Use this widget to quickly identify which pages are doing the most work for a client.

### Striking Distance

Striking Distance shows keywords currently ranking in positions 11–20 — one page away from the first page of results. These are your highest-leverage optimization targets because a small ranking improvement moves them onto page one.

Each row shows the keyword, its current position, and monthly search volume. Click through to the full Organic Rankings report for the complete list with KD%, CPC, and traffic data.

<Tip>
  The Striking Distance widget is one of the fastest ways to build a content brief or on-page optimization recommendation for a client. Position 11–20 keywords already have relevance — they just need a push.
</Tip>

## Refreshing data

Dashboard data reflects the most recent fetch RankLyft has completed for the domain. DataForSEO metrics refresh on the standard schedule, while GA4 and GSC data sync on their own daily cron jobs (`cron-sync-ga4` and `cron-sync-gsc`). To see when each data type was last updated, refer to [Refresh Schedules](/data/refresh-schedules).
