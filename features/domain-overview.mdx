Domain Overview gives you the complete picture of a domain's search presence over time. Where the Dashboard shows the current snapshot, Domain Overview shows how that snapshot has changed month over month going back to January of the prior year.

## Metric cards

At the top of the page, four metric cards display the domain's current organic and paid performance:

| Card | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Organic Traffic | Estimated monthly organic visits |
| Organic Keywords | Total keywords the domain currently ranks for |
| Paid Traffic | Estimated monthly traffic from paid search |
| Paid Keywords | Keywords the domain is actively buying in Google Ads |

## Position distribution chart

Below the metric cards, a bar chart breaks down all ranked keywords by their current position. RankLyft uses 12 buckets:

`#1` · `#2` · `#3` · `#4–5` · `#6–7` · `#8–10` · `#11–15` · `#16–20` · `#21–30` · `#31–50` · `#51–75` · `#76–100`

This chart tells you whether a domain's rankings are concentrated at the top (a strong, established site) or spread across mid and lower positions (a newer or recovering site). A healthy domain typically shows a right-skewed distribution with more keywords in positions 1–10.

## Historical trend charts

Two line charts plot monthly data from January of the prior year through the current month:

- **Organic Traffic trend** — estimated monthly visits over time
- **Organic Keywords trend** — total ranked keywords over time

Use these charts to identify seasonality, detect the impact of algorithm updates, and demonstrate growth (or flag declines) to clients during monthly reviews.

<Tip>
  Algorithm updates often cause sudden drops or spikes across multiple months. If you see a sharp movement in the trend chart, cross-reference it with major Google update dates to determine whether the change was site-specific or industry-wide.

## Movement counts

Below the charts, four counters show keyword movement since the last data pull:

| Counter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| New | Keywords that appeared in rankings for the first time |
| Up | Keywords that improved in position |
| Down | Keywords that dropped in position |
| Lost | Keywords that fell out of the top 100 entirely |

Movement counts give you a quick health check without having to sort through the full Organic Rankings table. A large "Lost" number warrants investigation in [Organic Rankings](/features/organic-rankings).

## Data freshness

Domain Overview data is fetched automatically when you add a website and refreshed on a regular schedule. Historical monthly data is not re-fetched retroactively — it captures the state of the domain at the time of each monthly pull. See [Refresh Schedules](/data/refresh-schedules) for timing details.
