Domain Overview gives you the complete picture of a domain's search presence. Where the Dashboard shows a quick snapshot, Domain Overview provides deep analysis across SEO metrics, historical trends, keyword breakdowns, and AI search visibility — all on a single page.

## Summary cards

Two panels at the top of the page display the domain's current performance:

### AI Search card

When [AI Visibility](/features/ai-visibility) is enabled, this card shows how the domain appears across AI platforms:

| Metric | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Mentions | Total times the domain was mentioned in AI responses |
| Citations | Times the domain was cited as a source |
| Citation Rate | Percentage of mentions that include a citation link |

A per-platform breakdown shows visibility across ChatGPT, Google AI Overview, Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude.

### SEO card

The SEO card displays the domain's core search metrics:

| Metric | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Authority Score | Domain authority rating with a quality badge (Excellent, Good, Fair, Fine, or Low) |
| Organic Traffic | Estimated monthly organic visits |
| Paid Traffic | Estimated monthly traffic from paid search |
| Ref. Domains | Count of unique referring domains |
| Traffic Value | Estimated monthly value of organic traffic in USD |
| Organic Keywords | Total keywords the domain ranks for |
| Paid Keywords | Keywords the domain buys in Google Ads |
| Backlinks | Total backlinks pointing to the domain |

<Info>
  Ref. Domains and Backlinks metrics are gated behind the backlinks feature flag. They appear as dashes when backlinks data is not enabled.

## SEO / AI Search section

Below the summary cards, a tabbed interface provides deep analysis with a time range filter (1M, 6M, 1Y, 2Y, All):

### Google Search tab

The Google Search tab contains five visualizations:

**Traffic chart** — a line chart plotting estimated organic traffic over time. Use this to identify seasonality, algorithm update impacts, and growth trends.

**Keywords stacked chart** — an area chart showing total ranked keywords over time, stacked by position range. This reveals whether keyword growth is coming from top positions or lower-ranked terms.

**Country table** — a breakdown of organic traffic by country, showing estimated traffic and keyword counts per geography.

**Branded bar** — shows the split between branded and non-branded organic traffic.

**SERP feature donut** — a donut chart showing which SERP features (featured snippets, People Also Ask, image packs, etc.) the domain appears in and how frequently.

### AI Search tab

When AI Visibility is enabled, this tab shows AI mention trends over time across platforms.

<Tip>
  Algorithm updates often cause sudden drops or spikes in the traffic chart. If you see a sharp movement, cross-reference it with major Google update dates to determine whether the change was site-specific or industry-wide.

## Top organic keywords

A table of the domain's top ranked keywords by estimated traffic. Each row shows the keyword, position, search volume, and traffic. Click **View all** to open the full [Organic Rankings](/features/organic-rankings) report.

## Position distribution

A donut chart breaks down all ranked keywords into five position buckets:

| Bucket | Positions |
|---|---|
| Top 3 | 1–3 |
| Top 10 | 4–10 |
| Top 20 | 11–20 |
| Top 50 | 21–50 |
| Top 100 | 51–100 |

A healthy domain typically shows a larger share in the top 10, indicating strong rankings. A distribution skewed toward 51–100 suggests the domain is gaining visibility but hasn't broken through to competitive positions yet.

## Keywords by intent

Four intent categories show how the domain's keywords are distributed by search intent:

| Intent | Description |
|---|---|
| Informational | Searches seeking information or answers |
| Navigational | Searches for a specific website or brand |
| Commercial | Research-oriented searches comparing products or services |
| Transactional | Searches with purchase or action intent |

Each category displays its keyword count and estimated traffic contribution.

## Keyword movement

A bar chart visualizes keyword changes since the last data pull:

| Bar | Meaning |
|---|---|
| New | Keywords that appeared in rankings for the first time |
| Improved | Keywords that moved to a better position |
| Declined | Keywords that dropped in position |
| Lost | Keywords that fell out of the top 100 entirely |

Each bar is clickable — clicking one opens [Organic Rankings](/features/organic-rankings) filtered to that movement type.

## Tracked competitors

A read-only table shows the competitor domains you've configured in [Site Settings](/features/site-settings):

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Domain | The competitor's domain name |
| Keywords | Total organic keywords the competitor ranks for |
| Traffic | Estimated monthly organic traffic |
| Traffic Value | Estimated monthly value of organic traffic in USD |

Click **Manage** to go to [Site Settings > Competitors](/features/site-settings#competitors) where you can add or remove tracked competitors.

## Data freshness

Domain Overview data is fetched automatically when you add a website and refreshed on a regular schedule. Historical monthly data is not re-fetched retroactively — it captures the state of the domain at the time of each monthly pull. See [Refresh Schedules](/data/refresh-schedules) for timing details.
