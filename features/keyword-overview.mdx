Keyword Overview lets you look up detailed data for any keyword in any country. Use it to evaluate a target keyword before writing content, check competitive difficulty, or investigate a specific term from the Organic Rankings table.

## Looking up a keyword

Enter a keyword and select a country, then click **Search**. RankLyft fetches keyword data from DataForSEO and caches the result. Subsequent lookups for the same keyword and country load from cache rather than making a new API call.

<Info>
  Keyword data is cached per keyword and country combination. If you need to refresh stale data for a keyword, contact your admin to clear the cache for that term.

## Keyword metrics

The top of the results page shows six metrics for the keyword:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Volume | Estimated monthly search volume in the selected country |
| KD% | Keyword Difficulty, 0–100. Color-coded: green (easy), yellow (medium), orange (hard), red (very hard). |
| CPC | Average cost per click in Google Ads, in USD |
| Competition | Paid search competition density, 0–1 |
| Intent | Search intent: **I** (Informational), **N** (Navigational), **C** (Commercial), or **T** (Transactional) |
| Volume Trend | Whether search volume is growing, stable, or declining |

### Understanding KD% colors

| Range | Color | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| 0–29 | Green | Low competition — achievable for most domains |
| 30–49 | Yellow | Moderate competition — requires solid content and some links |
| 50–74 | Orange | High competition — harder to rank without strong authority |
| 75–100 | Red | Very high competition — dominated by established, authoritative sites |

## Monthly search chart

A bar chart shows the estimated search volume for each month over the past 12 months. Use this to identify seasonal patterns before planning content. A keyword with high annual volume but concentrated in two or three months may not be worth targeting if timing does not align with the client's publishing schedule.

## SERP features

RankLyft lists the SERP features currently present for this keyword, such as:

- Featured Snippet
- People Also Ask
- Local Pack
- Shopping results
- Image Pack
- Video results

SERP features indicate what Google considers the most relevant content type for this query. A keyword with a Featured Snippet opportunity is worth targeting with a structured, answer-forward content format. A keyword with a Local Pack suggests Google interprets it as a local-intent query.

## Top 10 organic results

The SERP preview shows the current top 10 organic results for the keyword, with each result's title and URL. Use this to assess:

- Who dominates this keyword (news sites, e-commerce, directories, blogs)
- Whether any client competitors appear
- Whether the content type matches what the client could realistically produce

## Average backlinks for top 10

Below the SERP preview, RankLyft shows the average number of referring domains pointing to the top 10 results. This is a practical proxy for how much link authority a page needs to compete for this keyword. If the average is 200 referring domains and the client's target page has 5, that is a significant gap that content quality alone will not close.

<Tip>
  Use Keyword Overview before writing a content brief. If the top 10 results are all high-authority publications and the average backlink count is far above what the client's page can realistically achieve, flag that before the client invests in content production.
