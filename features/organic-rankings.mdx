Organic Rankings gives you a full view of a domain's current keyword footprint. Every keyword the domain ranks for in the top 100 positions appears here, with enough data to prioritize content work, identify quick wins, and monitor position changes over time.

## Table columns

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Keyword | The search query. Links to the Keyword Overview page for that term. |
| Intent | Search intent badge: **I** (Informational), **N** (Navigational), **C** (Commercial), **T** (Transactional) |
| Position | Current Google ranking. Color-coded: green for 1–3, yellow for 4–10, orange for 11–20, gray for 21+. |
| Change | Movement since last pull. Shows an up or down arrow with the number of positions moved, **NEW** for first-time appearances, or **LOST** for keywords that dropped out. |
| KD% | Keyword Difficulty, 0–100. Higher scores mean more competition. |
| Volume | Estimated monthly search volume |
| Traffic | Estimated monthly organic visits the domain receives from this keyword |
| CPC | Cost per click in Google Ads, in USD |
| Competition | Paid search competition level (0–1 scale) |

## Position distribution bar

Above the table, a horizontal bar shows the proportion of ranked keywords across position ranges. This gives you a quick visual on how top-heavy or spread out the domain's rankings are before you start filtering.

## Filters

Use URL-based filters to narrow the table without losing your place. The following filter parameters appear in the URL when active:

| Filter | Parameter | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum position | `pos_min` | Show only keywords at or below this position number |
| Maximum position | `pos_max` | Show only keywords at or above this position number |
| Change type | `change` | Filter by movement: `new`, `up`, `down`, or `lost` |

<Tip>
  To build a striking-distance report, set `pos_min=11` and `pos_max=20`. You'll see every keyword within range of page one.

## Exporting data

Click the **Export CSV** button in the table header to download the current filtered view as a CSV file. The export respects active filters, so what you see is what you get in the download. Use this to build client reports or import data into a spreadsheet for further analysis.

## Clicking through to Keyword Overview

Every keyword in the table links to its [Keyword Overview](/features/keyword-overview) page. From there you can see the full SERP, monthly search trend, and competitive difficulty breakdown for that term.

<Info>
