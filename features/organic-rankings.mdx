Organic Rankings gives you a full view of a domain's current keyword footprint. Every keyword the domain ranks for in the top 100 positions appears here, with enough data to prioritize content work, identify quick wins, and monitor position changes over time.

When [Google Search Console](/features/google-integrations) is connected, GSC-discovered keywords are merged into the table alongside DataForSEO data, giving you real click and impression counts next to estimated metrics.

## Google Search Console integration

When a GSC property is mapped to the website, Organic Rankings merges two data sources into a single table. Each keyword gets a data source badge:

| Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| DataForSEO | Keyword found via DataForSEO's index only |
| GSC | Keyword discovered through Google Search Console only |
| Both | Keyword appears in both DataForSEO and GSC data |

<Info>
  GSC-only keywords show dashes for Intent, KD%, and Competition since those metrics come from DataForSEO's index and aren't available for keywords only discovered through Search Console.
</Info>

<Info>
  The number of GSC-discovered keywords displayed is subject to your subscription plan limit. Upgrade your plan to see more GSC keywords.

## Position changes chart

Above the table, a small chart shows the breakdown of keyword movements (New, Up, Down, Lost) at a glance. Use this to quickly gauge whether the domain is trending positively or negatively before diving into the table.

## Table columns

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Keyword | The search query. Links to the Keyword Overview page for that term. |
| Intent | Search intent badge: **I** (Informational), **N** (Navigational), **C** (Commercial), **T** (Transactional) |
| Position | Current Google ranking. Color-coded: green for 1–10, blue for 10–30, yellow for 30+. |
| Change | Movement since last pull. Shows an up or down arrow with the number of positions moved, **NEW** for first-time appearances, or **LOST** for keywords that dropped out. |
| Traffic | Estimated monthly organic visits the domain receives from this keyword |
| KD% | Keyword Difficulty, 0–100. Higher scores mean more competition. |
| Volume | Estimated monthly search volume |
| Clicks | Real clicks from Google search results (GSC data) |
| Impressions | Real impressions in Google search results (GSC data) |
| CTR | Real click-through rate from search results (GSC data) |
| Source | Data source badge: DataForSEO, GSC, or Both |

## Position distribution bar

Above the table, a horizontal bar shows the proportion of ranked keywords across position ranges. This gives you a quick visual on how top-heavy or spread out the domain's rankings are before you start filtering.

## Filters

Use URL-based filters to narrow the table. Filters are reflected in the URL so you can share filtered views:

| Filter | Parameter | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Tab | `tab` | Filter by movement type: All, New, Up, Down, or Lost |
| Position range | `pos` | Quick-filter pills for common ranges (Top 3, 4–10, 11–20, etc.) |
| Min position | `pos_min` | Show only keywords at or below this position number |
| Max position | `pos_max` | Show only keywords at or above this position number |
| Change type | `change` | Filter by movement: `new`, `up`, `down`, or `lost` |
| Device | `device` | Filter by device type (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet) |
| Days | `days` | Time range for GSC data |

<Tip>
  To build a striking-distance report, set `pos_min=11` and `pos_max=20`. You'll see every keyword within range of page one.
</Tip>

## Exporting data

Click the **Export CSV** button in the table header to download the current filtered view as a CSV file. The export respects active filters, so what you see is what you get in the download. Use this to build client reports or import data into a spreadsheet for further analysis.

## Clicking through to Keyword Overview

Every keyword in the table links to its [Keyword Overview](/features/keyword-overview) page. From there you can see the full SERP, monthly search trend, and competitive difficulty breakdown for that term.

<Info>
  The table shows data as of the most recent fetch. Rankings change daily, and RankLyft refreshes organic ranking data on a scheduled basis. For real-time daily position tracking on specific keywords, use [Position Tracking](/features/position-tracking).
