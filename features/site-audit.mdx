description: "An on-demand and scheduled technical SEO crawl that scores a site's health and surfaces issues across six categories."
---

Site Audit crawls a client's website and produces a technical SEO health report. It identifies issues across six categories, assigns a health score, and lets you compare results against previous crawls to track progress over time.

## Starting a crawl

Crawl configuration — page limits, depth, crawler behavior, and schedule — is managed in [Site Settings > Crawl Settings](/features/site-settings#crawl-settings). The **Run Audit** button on the Site Audit page starts a crawl using those saved settings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure crawl settings">
    Before your first crawl, visit [Site Settings > Crawl Settings](/features/site-settings#crawl-settings) to set the page limit, crawl depth, crawler behavior (subdomains, sitemap, JS rendering), and schedule.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the crawl">
    Return to the Site Audit page and click **Run Audit**. RankLyft queues the crawl via the DataForSEO On-Page API. The crawl runs asynchronously — you can navigate away and return later. RankLyft polls for results every 10 seconds while you're on the page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Scheduled audits run automatically via the [`cron-run-scheduled-audits`](/reference/cron-run-scheduled-audits) daily cron job, using the schedule and settings configured in Site Settings.

<Warning>
  JavaScript rendering increases the cost per crawled page by approximately 10x compared to standard crawling. Only enable it if the site requires JS to render its content. Most static or server-rendered sites do not need it.
</Warning>

## Health score

The health score appears as a 0–100 number at the top of the audit results. It reflects the overall technical condition of the site based on the issues found:

```
Health Score = 100 - (Errors × 3) - (Warnings × 1) - (Notices × 0.2)
```

| Severity | Score impact per issue |
|---|---|
| Error | −3 points |
| Warning | −1 point |
| Notice | −0.2 points |

A score of 80+ is generally healthy. Scores below 60 indicate significant technical problems that warrant immediate attention.

## Issue categories

Issues are organized into six categories:

<Accordion title="Indexability">
  Pages that search engines cannot or should not index. Common issues: noindex tags on important pages, pages blocked by `robots.txt`, redirect chains, and canonical tag mismatches.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Content">
  Issues with page content quality and structure. Common issues: duplicate titles, missing or short meta descriptions, thin content, missing H1 tags, and duplicate content across pages.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Links">
  Internal and external link problems. Common issues: broken internal links, broken external links, orphan pages with no internal links pointing to them, and redirect loops.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance">
  Page load and user experience signals. Common issues: large uncompressed images, missing lazy loading, excessive page size, and slow server response times.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Security">
  HTTPS and security-related issues. Common issues: mixed content warnings, missing HTTPS, and expired SSL certificates.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Technical">
  Crawl and technical infrastructure issues. Common issues: missing or malformed `robots.txt`, sitemap errors, hreflang misconfigurations, and missing structured data.
</Accordion>

## Filtering issues

Use the category and severity filters above the issue table to focus on specific problem types. You can filter by:

- **Category** — show only one of the six categories
- **Severity** — show only Errors, Warnings, or Notices

Start with Errors and work down. Fixing errors has the largest impact on the health score.

## Crawl comparison

When you run a second or subsequent audit, RankLyft compares the results against the previous crawl and shows deltas for each issue type. This lets you demonstrate to clients that technical issues are being resolved over time, or flag new issues that appeared since the last audit.

<Tip>
  Run an audit before and after any major site change — a platform migration, redesign, or CMS update. The comparison view will immediately surface any new issues introduced by the change.
</Tip>

## Crawl status and polling

After starting a crawl, RankLyft shows a progress indicator and polls the DataForSEO API every 10 seconds. Depending on the number of pages and whether JS rendering is enabled, a crawl typically completes in 2–15 minutes. You do not need to keep the tab open — results will be saved when the crawl finishes.
