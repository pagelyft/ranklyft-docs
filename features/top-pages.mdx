Top Pages shows which URLs on a client's site are actually delivering organic visitors. It surfaces the 50 highest-traffic pages by estimated organic visits, giving you a quick read on where the site's SEO value is concentrated.

## Table columns

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Page URL | The full URL of the page |
| ETV | Estimated Traffic Value — the estimated monthly value of the organic traffic this page receives, in USD |
| Keywords | The number of keywords this page ranks for in the top 100 |
| Traffic Value | The estimated dollar value of the organic traffic this page drives |
| Change | Movement since the previous data pull: **Up**, **Down**, **New**, or **Lost** |

## Change tracking

Each page is compared against the previous pull's estimated traffic value (ETV). The Change column reflects whether the page gained traffic, lost traffic, appeared for the first time, or dropped out of the top 50 entirely:

| Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Up | The page's ETV increased since the last pull |
| Down | The page's ETV decreased since the last pull |
| New | The page entered the top 50 for the first time |
| Lost | The page dropped out of the top 50 |

<Tip>
  Pages marked **Lost** are worth investigating. A page that previously drove significant traffic and dropped out of the top 50 may have experienced a ranking drop, a crawl issue, or been removed. Cross-reference with Organic Rankings to see if its primary keywords also dropped.

## How to use Top Pages

**Identify revenue-critical pages.** Sort by ETV to see which pages generate the most monetizable traffic. These are the pages where on-page issues or technical problems have the highest potential business impact.

**Find content gaps.** Pages with high keyword counts but low ETV are ranking for many low-value terms. Consider whether those pages could be optimized to target higher-value queries.

**Spot early declines.** Pages marked Down with significant ETV drops often signal a ranking problem before it becomes visible in overall traffic numbers. Check these pages in Organic Rankings to identify which specific keywords are falling.

**Brief content teams.** Export the table and share with content or development teams to prioritize page-level work based on actual traffic impact rather than assumptions.
