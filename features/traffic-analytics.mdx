Traffic Analytics gives you a real-traffic view of a website's performance using data from Google Analytics 4. Unlike the estimated traffic numbers on Domain Overview, everything on this page comes directly from GA4 — actual users, sessions, engagement metrics, and conversions.

<Info>
  Traffic Analytics requires a connected GA4 property. If no property is linked, you'll see an empty state with a link to connect one. See [Google Integrations](/features/google-integrations) for setup instructions.

## Date range selector

Use the date range selector at the top of the page to control the reporting window. The range is controlled by a `?days=` URL parameter:

| Parameter | Default | Range |
|---|---|---|
| `days` | 30 | 1–365 |

All metrics, charts, and tables on the page update to reflect the selected range. Period-over-period comparisons use the equivalent prior period (e.g., 30 days vs. the previous 30 days).

## Summary metrics

Six metric cards appear at the top of the page, each with a period-over-period change badge showing the percentage increase or decrease compared to the previous period:

| Metric | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Users | Unique visitors during the selected period |
| Sessions | Total sessions started |
| Engaged Sessions | Sessions lasting longer than 10 seconds, with a conversion, or with 2+ page views |
| Avg. Engagement | Average engagement time per session (displayed as MM:SS) |
| Engagement Rate | Percentage of sessions that were engaged |
| Conversion Rate | Percentage of sessions that resulted in a conversion event |

## Traffic trend chart

A line/area chart plots daily sessions and users over time, broken down by traffic channel. Use this to spot trends, traffic spikes, or drops correlated with marketing campaigns or algorithm updates.

## Channel breakdown

A pie chart and table show traffic distribution across acquisition channels:

- **Organic Search** — visitors from unpaid search results
- **Direct** — visitors who typed the URL directly
- **Referral** — visitors from links on other sites
- **Paid Social** — visitors from paid social campaigns
- **Display** — visitors from display ad campaigns
- **Email** — visitors from email campaigns
- **Other** — all remaining channels

## Device breakdown

A table showing user counts split by device type: Desktop, Mobile, and Tablet.

## Country breakdown

A table of the top 10 countries by user count, paired with a geographic map visualization.

<Tip>
  Cross-reference Traffic Analytics with [Organic Rankings](/features/organic-rankings) to compare real GA4 traffic against DataForSEO's estimated organic traffic. This helps you calibrate how closely the estimates track actual performance.

## Data freshness

GA4 data is synced daily via the `cron-sync-ga4` job. There is typically a 24–48 hour delay between when a visit occurs in GA4 and when it appears in RankLyft. See [Refresh Schedules](/data/refresh-schedules) for timing details.
