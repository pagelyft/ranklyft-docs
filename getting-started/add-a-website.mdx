When you add a website to RankLyft, it kicks off an automatic data fetch for that domain. You don't need to configure anything — RankLyft pulls everything it needs from DataForSEO and saves it to your account.

## How to add a website

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Add Website form">
    Click the **+** button at the top of the sidebar, or navigate directly to **/new**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the domain">
    Type the domain in bare format. Do not include the protocol or subdomain:

    | Format | Correct? |
    |---|---|
    | `example.com` | Yes |
    | `https://example.com` | No |
    | `www.example.com` | No |
    | `blog.example.com` | Only if you want to track the subdomain specifically |

    RankLyft treats the domain as entered, so make sure you enter the root domain unless you specifically want to track a subdomain.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an optional label">
    You can add a display label — for example, the client's business name — to make the website easier to identify in the sidebar. This is purely cosmetic and does not affect data fetching.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit">
    Click **Add Website**. The initial data fetch starts immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What gets fetched automatically

When you add a domain, RankLyft runs the following fetches in the background:

| Data | Details |
|---|---|
| Domain overview | Domain authority score, estimated monthly traffic, total backlinks, referring domains |
| Ranked keywords | Up to the top 100 keywords the domain currently ranks for in Google |
| Top pages | Up to the top 50 pages by estimated organic traffic |
| Historical data | Monthly traffic and ranking snapshots back to January of the prior year |
| Position tracking seed | The domain's top-performing keywords are added to Position Tracking automatically |

The full fetch takes **15–30 seconds**. You can navigate away and the data will be ready when you return.

<Info>
  Newer domains or domains with limited search presence may return fewer than 100 keywords or 50 pages. This is expected — DataForSEO only returns data that exists in its index. As the domain builds more rankings over time, subsequent refreshes will return more results.

## Managing multiple websites

You can add as many websites as your plan supports. Each website has its own independent dashboard, keyword set, and historical data — nothing is shared between websites.

Use the sidebar switcher to move between client websites. See [Managing websites](/getting-started/managing-websites) for more on switching, renaming, and removing domains.
