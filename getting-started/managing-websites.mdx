RankLyft is built around a multi-website model. Each website you add gets its own dashboard, keyword set, and data history. You can switch between them at any time from the sidebar.

## Switching between websites

The sidebar displays all of your active websites. Click any website name to switch to it. The entire interface — dashboard, position tracking, site audit, and all other sections — updates to reflect the selected domain.

There is no limit to how many websites you can have active at once.

## Adding more websites

To add another website, click the **+** button at the top of the sidebar, or navigate to **/new**. Each new website goes through the same automatic data fetch as your first — see [Adding a website](/getting-started/add-a-website) for a full breakdown of what gets fetched.

Every website is independent. Adding a new domain does not affect the data or settings of any other website in your account.

## Removing a website

To remove a website, open its settings and select **Delete Website** (or the equivalent remove action in the UI).

RankLyft uses **soft-delete** — the domain and all of its associated data are retained in the database even after deletion. The website is simply hidden from your sidebar and is no longer actively tracked.

<Info>
  Soft-delete means your historical ranking data, keyword lists, and audit results are preserved. Nothing is permanently erased when you remove a website.

## Restoring a deleted website

If you need to restore a domain you previously deleted, contact your PageLyft admin. Because RankLyft retains all data on soft-delete, restoration brings back the full history — ranked keywords, position tracking history, top pages, and domain overview snapshots — exactly as they were before the domain was removed.

You do not lose any data by deleting and later restoring a website.
