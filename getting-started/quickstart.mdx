Follow these steps to go from a fresh account to live ranking data for your first client domain.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in">
    Go to [rank.pagelyft.studio/login](https://rank.pagelyft.studio/login) and enter the email and password your admin provided. RankLyft does not have a self-service signup — your account is created for you.

    After logging in, you'll land on the main dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your first website">
    Click the **+** button in the sidebar (or navigate to **/new**) to open the Add Website form.

    Enter the domain in bare format — no `https://`, no `www`:

    ```
    example.com
    ```

    Optionally add a label to identify the client, then click **Add Website**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for the initial data fetch">
    RankLyft immediately kicks off a background fetch for the domain. This pulls the domain overview, top 100 ranked keywords, top 50 pages, and historical ranking data.

    The fetch takes approximately **15–30 seconds**. You'll see the dashboard populate as data arrives. You can stay on the page or navigate away — the data will be there when you return.
  </Step>

  <Step title="View the Dashboard">
    Once the fetch completes, open the website's **Dashboard**. You'll see:

    - Domain authority and estimated monthly traffic
    - Top ranked keywords with their current positions
    - Top organic pages by estimated traffic
    - A traffic trend chart going back to January of the prior year

    This gives you an immediate baseline for the client's current SEO standing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Position Tracking">
    Navigate to **Position Tracking** in the sidebar. RankLyft automatically seeds this list with the domain's top-performing keywords, so you don't have to add them manually.

    You'll see the keyword list, but position data will not appear until the first tracking run completes.

    <Info>
      Position tracking runs daily at **6 AM UTC**. Fresh rank data for your newly added keywords will appear the following morning. All subsequent days update automatically on the same schedule.
