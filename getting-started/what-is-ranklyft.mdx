RankLyft is an SEO platform built for digital agencies. It gives you keyword tracking, site auditing, backlink analysis, and competitive research — all in one place — without the enterprise price tag.

## What RankLyft does

RankLyft connects to the DataForSEO API to pull real search data for any domain you add. When you add a client website, RankLyft automatically fetches:

- **Ranked keywords** — the top 100 keywords the domain currently ranks for in Google
- **Top pages** — the 50 pages driving the most organic traffic
- **Domain overview** — domain authority, estimated traffic, and backlink counts
- **Historical data** — ranking history back to January of the prior year
- **Position tracking** — daily rank tracking for your most important keywords, starting the next morning

Beyond the initial fetch, RankLyft continues to pull fresh data on a daily schedule so you always have current rankings to show clients.

## Who it's for

RankLyft is built for agencies managing SEO for multiple clients. If you're running monthly reports, tracking keyword movements, auditing technical issues, or doing competitive research across a book of clients, RankLyft is designed for that workflow.

Each website you add gets its own isolated dashboard. You can switch between clients, track independent keyword sets, and export data without mixing accounts.

## Powered by DataForSEO

RankLyft uses [DataForSEO](https://dataforseo.com) as its data backend — the same underlying API that many enterprise SEO tools use. Because DataForSEO bills per API call rather than per seat, RankLyft passes those savings directly to you.

## Cost comparison

| Tool | Plan | Monthly Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Semrush | Guru | ~$250/mo |
| Ahrefs | Standard | ~$200/mo |
| RankLyft | Agency | $20–40/mo |

You get comparable data coverage at roughly 85% lower cost.
